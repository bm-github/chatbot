# OpenAI Chatbot with Tkinter

This is a GUI-based chatbot application built using Python’s `tkinter` library and OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 API. It allows users to interact with the chatbot, save and load conversations, and regenerate responses. The chatbot has different modes, including code analysis and adding comments to code.

## Features

- **Interactive Chatbot**: A simple, user-friendly interface for chatting with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model.
- **Code Analysis**: Break down code or add comments to code via specialised prompts.
- **Conversation History**: Save and load conversations from files stored in a `history` folder.
- **Regenerate Responses**: Regenerate the last AI response to the user’s message.
- **File Management**: Load and delete saved conversations from the UI.
