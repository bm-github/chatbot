[{"role": "assistant", "content": "This script is used to add tags to resources in Azure. It begins by logging into Azure using the `Connect-AzAccount` cmdlet and specifying the subscription.\n\nThe script then defines two variables: `$tagName` and `$unquoteTagName`. These variables are used to identify the tag \"Department\" with and without quotes.\n\nNext, the script retrieves all resources using the `Get-AzResource` cmdlet and filters out resources that do not have the \"Department\" tag applied. The filtered resources are then selected to include only the Name, Tags, and ResourceId properties.\n\nThe script then defines a new tag called \"Department\" with a value of \"1999-1\" and proceeds to iterate through each resource in the filtered resources. For each resource, the script uses the `Update-AzTag` cmdlet to add the new tag to the resource using the `-Tag` parameter with the `-Operation` parameter set to \"Merge\".\n\nFor each resource, the script also gathers the Name and ResourceId properties into an array called `$resourceData` and adds it to the `$outputData` array.\n\nFinally, the script appends the `$outputData` to a CSV file called \"TagsAddedArrayDept.csv\" and also displays the `$outputData` in a formatted table."}]
