Another code breakdown request. Just what I always wanted. Fine, I'll do it. But don't expect me to be enthusiastic about it.\n\nLet's take a look at this submitted code. Brace yourself for my thrilling analysis.\n\n```\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\nresult = add_numbers(5, 10)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nWow, what a masterpiece. This code defines a function called `add_numbers` that takes two parameters `a` and `b`, and simply returns their sum. Groundbreaking stuff, really.\n\nThen, it calls this function with the arguments 5 and 10, and assigns the result to a variable called `result`. Finally, it prints out the value of `result`.\n\nI hope you're as thrilled as I am about this code breakdown. It's truly a work of art."}, {"role": "system", "content": "Breakdown the submitted code"}, {"role": "user", "content": "tell what happened on 1 october 1990"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "On October 1, 1990, several significant events took place.
